# Breast-Cancer-Detection-Diagnosis-and-Classification
This project focuses on implementing a neural network model to detect and classify breast cancer as either malignant or benign. Leveraging machine learning, significally neural networks (NN), offers the potential to automate and enhance diagnostic accuracy, enabling early detection and better patient outcomes.
